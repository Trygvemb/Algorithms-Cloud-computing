#### Learning Objectives for Algorithms and Optimization

##### Subject Description

Optimization and Automation are fundamental to efficient software development and systems design. This subject focuses on designing systems that maximize performance and efficiency while reducing manual effort through automation. It draws on concepts from algorithms, cloud computing, and containerization technologies, such as Docker, to create scalable, reliable, and cost-effective solutions.

The subject builds on the foundations of algorithms and data structures to optimize application performance, while automation practices ensure efficient deployment, testing, and maintenance of applications. These skills are essential for modern software development, particularly in cloud-based and distributed systems, making the subject highly relevant to both my academic goals and future career aspirations.

##### Formulation of Learning Objectives

###### Long-Term Learning Objectives

**Knowledge**

- Understand principles of optimization, including time and space complexity analysis (Big-O notation) and their impact on system performance.
- Understand the role of automation in software development and cloud computing, including CI/CD pipelines and container orchestration.
- Gain insights into the use of cloud services for optimizing workloads (e.g., cost efficiency, scalability, and availability).

**Skills**

- Understanding the theory behind basic and commonly used algorithms and data structures.
- Apply optimization techniques to improve the efficiency of algorithms and system performance.
- Use Docker to containerize applications, automate deployments, and ensure consistent runtime environments.
- Leverage cloud tools and APIs (AWS and Azure) for automation and optimization in cloud-based applications.

**Competencies**

- Analyze system performance to identify and implement optimization opportunities.
- Develop and manage automated workflows for deployment, scaling, and monitoring.
- Combine algorithmic knowledge with practical tools like Docker and cloud platforms to design robust, efficient solutions.

###### Short-Term Learning Objectives

- Explore commonly used data structures and algorithms, implementing them in C# and analyzing their performance.
- Build and deploy containerized applications using Docker, with a focus on automation and scalability.
- Learn and apply routing and GraphQL queries/mutations in project contexts to optimize data retrieval and system communication.
- Complete the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals and AZ-204 learning plans, focusing on automation tools and services.
- Implement optimization techniques in the WePack.PMS project, such as automated deployment pipelines and performance testing.

#### Quality Criteria

##### Identification of Quality Criteria

- **Clarity**: Objectives must be specific and actionable, such as mastering Docker basics or completing Azure certification modules.
- **Measurability**: Progress should be documented through completed exercises, implemented features in the WePack.PMS project, and certifications.
- **Relevance**: Goals should align with the practical requirements of the WePack.PMS project and professional development in cloud computing and automation.
- **Feedback Opportunities**: Regular evaluations from peers or mentors to assess implementation quality and understanding.

##### Application of Criteria

These criteria are used as benchmarks to ensure that the learning objectives are realistic, concrete, and aimed at practical application and understanding.

#### Communication

Short-term goals support long-term objectives by providing concrete steps like completing certifications, implementing Docker workflows, and applying optimization techniques in real-world projects. For instance, the knowledge gained from Azure courses directly informs the automation strategies used in the WePack.PMS project, bridging theory with practice.
