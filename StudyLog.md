    - Finished.

- Notes
  - After finishing the AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials course, I decided to also do the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals course to get a broader understanding of cloud computing. I will also do some Docker courses to get a better understanding of containerization.

## September

  - Docker Get Started Course [Link](https://docs.docker.com/get-started)

- Notes
  - After finishing the Docker Get Started course, I and while studying the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals course, I realized that I wanted to do more of the Azure courses to get a better understanding of the Azure platform. I will continue with the Azure courses and then I might do some more Docker courses.
  - I decided to focus on Azure since most danish companies use Microsoft products and services.

- Notes
  - I finished the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals course and I am now doing the AZ-305 Microsoft Azure Architect Design Prerequisites course. I will then do the AZ-204 course to get a better understanding of Azure development.
  - I have been focusing mainly on Azure and the cloud computing part of my studies since this is such a big subject and it takes time to get a good understanding of the different services and how they work together.
  - I'm currently deciding if I should do the AZ-204 exam to get the Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate certification. But i know it will takes some time to get ready for the exam and i still need to do some more work on Algorithms and the Project as well.
