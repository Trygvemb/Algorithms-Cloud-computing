#### Learning Objectives for Algorithms and Optimization

##### Subject Description

This subject focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms and optimization techniques to create efficient, scalable, and maintainable systems. It builds on foundational concepts in data structures and algorithms to enhance problem-solving skills and explores optimization through practical tools like Docker and cloud computing services.

The subject aims to bridge theoretical knowledge and practical application, ensuring an understanding of computational efficiency while using modern tools for performance enhancement and automation. Mastering these skills is essential for backend development, system design, and effective deployment in distributed and cloud-based environments.
