#### Learning Objectives for Algorithms

##### Subject Description

Algorithms are fundamental building blocks in computer science, used to solve complex problems efficiently. By learning about algorithms, one not only gains knowledge of specific techniques and data structures but also develops a general approach to problem-solving that can be applied in various situations. I have chosen this subject because it is crucial to be able to design and implement effective solutions to real-world problems, and understanding algorithms is often the key to writing faster and more efficient programs. Additionally, algorithms are a central topic in technical job interviews and are relevant for many professional development tasks.

##### Formulation of Learning Objectives

###### Long-Term Learning Objectives

**Knowledge**

- Understanding the theory behind basic and commonly used algorithms.
- Understanding time and space complexity (Big-O notation) and how it affects the performance of algorithms.
- Understanding data structures and their applications in algorithms.
- Understanding the correctness and efficiency in the design of algorithms.

**Skills**

- Apply and implement various algorithms to solve specific problems.
- Implement algorithms in C# and analyze their complexity.
- Choose and apply the most appropriate data structure for a given problem.
- Use tools to analyze and optimize the performance of algorithms.

**Competencies**

- Identify, analyze, and define problems that can be solved using algorithms.
- Evaluate and choose the most suitable algorithm to solve a given problem.
- Learn and apply new algorithms and data structures when required by complex tasks.

###### Short-Term Learning Objectives

- Read and understand the first chapter of *Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)* and complete all exercises.
- Implement the algorithms introduced in the chapter in small C# applications.
- Develop an understanding of the time and space complexity of algorithms by analyzing their performance through practice.
- Practice identifying appropriate algorithms and data structures for simple tasks and implement them effectively.

#### Quality Criteria

##### Identification of Quality Criteria

- **Clarity**: It must be clear what is expected to be achieved within each learning activity.
- **Measurability**: Understanding and implementation of specific algorithms should be documented through code and analysis.
- **Timeframe**: Each goal should have a clearly defined deadline for completion.
- **Opportunity for Feedback**: Regular reviews and evaluations of progress with the possibility of adjusting learning objectives as needed.

##### Application of Criteria

These criteria are used as benchmarks to ensure that the learning objectives are realistic, concrete, and aimed at practical application and understanding.

#### Communication

The short-term goals support the long-term goals by making them concrete through reading, exercises, and practical implementations. For example, the long-term goals of "Understanding the theory behind basic algorithms" and "Applying and implementing various algorithms" are translated into specific tasks such as completing exercises from the book and implementing algorithms in small programs.
