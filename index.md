Welcome to my portfolio, where I document my learning journey and projects as part of my Computer Science and Software Development education. This semester, I have chosen two elective courses: **Algorithms/Optimization** and **Cloud Computing**. Alongside these subjects, I am also working on a project for the company WePack with my team.

For a more detailed overview of the courses I have done, you can check out my [Study Log](StudyLog.md).

# The Process and how focus changed throughout the semester.

I started the semester with a focus on Algorithms, as I needed to build a strong foundation in this area. I spent the first few weeks studying algorithms, data structures, and time complexity analysis. As I progressed, I realized the that my interest lay more in the practical application of algorithms and cloud computing rather than the theoretical aspects. This shift in focus led me to explore more hands-on projects and real-world applications of the concepts I was learning. I decided to learn more about Docker and containerization, as well as cloud services like AWS and Azure, to enhance my skills in optimization and automation. I also started working on the WePack project, which allowed me to apply my knowledge in a practical setting. There was many hard learning curves in relation to implementing GraphQL, containerization of the project and hosting the project on Azure. I therefore spend a considerable amount of time on these topics and did not get to dive as deep into Algorithms as I had initially planned.

Another aspect that I found challenging was the integration of the different parts of the project. I had to ensure that the front-end and back-end communicated effectively, that the database was set up correctly, and that the hosting environment was optimized for performance. This required me to apply my knowledge of algorithms and cloud computing to design efficient solutions and troubleshoot issues that arose during development.

I also chose to keep this portfolio as a continuous log of my progress, rather than a static document. This allowed me to reflect on my learning journey, track my achievements, and adapt my goals as needed. I chose tho set it up with Github Pages and Jekyll to make it easy to update and maintain. With the implementation of continuous integration and deployment, I could focus on content creation and project work without worrying about the technical aspects of hosting the portfolio, but this still gave me a good understanding of how to set up a CI/CD pipeline.

For more insight into the thought I made during this process, please see the notes in [Study Log](StudyLog.md) or [Projects](Projects.md). You can also find links to the finished hosted project in the bottom of the [Projects](Projects.md) page.

# [Algorithms/Optimization](Algorithms.md)

**Why I Chose Algorithms/Optimization**

Algorithms are the core of problem-solving in computer science. They form the foundation of efficient programming and are essential for developing solutions that can scale and perform well. I chose Algorithms because mastering this subject will enhance my ability to design and implement robust software solutions, which is crucial in backend development and system design.

Optimization and automation are key components of modern software development. By learning how to optimize algorithms, systems, and processes, I can create more efficient and scalable applications. Automation helps streamline development workflows, reduce manual errors, and improve deployment processes. I chose Optimization and Automation to gain practical skills in enhancing system performance and automating repetitive tasks, which are essential for building reliable and cost-effective software solutions.

# [Cloud Computing](CloudComputing.md)

**Why I Chose Cloud Computing**

Cloud computing is revolutionizing how businesses operate by offering scalable, on-demand resources. With the increasing use of cloud services like AWS, Azure and GCP it is becoming more important to understand cloud architecture and services. I chose Cloud Computing to gain practical skills in implementing, managing, and optimizing cloud-based systems, which are critical in today's tech industry.

**How Algorithms and Cloud Computing Fit Together**

Understanding algorithms is vital when working with large systems, especially in a cloud environment. Efficient algorithms reduce the required computational power and ensure that cloud-based applications can handle large amounts of data without compromising performance.

# [Project](Projects.md)

## Team Project - WePack.PMS

### Project Overview

WePack is a company that operates multiple webshops, such as Lux-Case.dk and Urrem.dk, in different countries and languages. The company faces challenges in managing their product database across platforms like Shopify resulting in duplicated work when products need to be uploaded, updated, or deleted.

**Problem Statement**

WePack needs a unified system to manage their product database, which currently contains about 180,000 unique items. This system must integrate with Shopify’s GraphQL to streamline product management across all platforms from a single interface.

**Proposed Solution**

Our team is developing a centralized product management system called **WePack.PMS** that will:

- Consolidate product data into a unified system.
- Integrate with Shopify for efficient product management.
- Handle large amounts of data and be scalable for future growth.
- Ensure user-friendly and intuitive interfaces for easy use.
- Set up hosting on Azure for reliable performance and availability.
- Build API endpoints for data retrieval and management.

### Team Members & Roles

- **Kasper**: Product Owner (PO) with in-depth knowledge of WePack’s systems and requirements, focusing on backend architecture.
- **Trygve**: Ensures a stable and functional system by leveraging expertise in Cloud Computing and Algorithms.
- **Adam**: Specializes in frontend development with a focus on UI/UX, creating an intuitive user experience using React.

## Conclusion

This portfolio showcases my progress in learning about Algorithms, Optimization and Cloud Computing while applying these skills in real-world projects. Through this combination, I strive to build scalable, efficient, and user-friendly systems that address real business challenges.
