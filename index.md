Welcome to my portfolio, where I document my learning journey and projects as part of my Computer Science and Software Development education. This semester, I have chosen two elective courses: **Algorithms** and **Cloud Computing**. Alongside these subjects, I am also working on a project for the company WePack with my team.

# [Algorithms](Algorithms.md)

**Why I Chose Algorithms**

Algorithms are the core of problem-solving in computer science. They form the foundation of efficient programming and are essential for developing solutions that can scale and perform well. I chose Algorithms because mastering this subject will enhance my ability to design and implement robust software solutions, which is crucial in backend development and system design.

# [Cloud Computing](CloudComputing.md)

**Why I Chose Cloud Computing**

Cloud computing is revolutionizing how businesses operate by offering scalable, on-demand resources. With the increasing use of cloud services like AWS, it is becoming more important to understand cloud architecture and services. I chose Cloud Computing to gain practical skills in implementing, managing, and optimizing cloud-based systems, which are critical in today's tech industry.

**How Algorithms and Cloud Computing Fit Together**

Understanding algorithms is vital when working with large systems, especially in a cloud environment. Efficient algorithms reduce the required computational power and ensure that cloud-based applications can handle large amounts of data without compromising performance.

## Team Project - WePack.PMS

### Project Overview

WePack is a company that operates multiple webshops, such as Lux-Case.dk and Urrem.dk, in different countries and languages. The company faces challenges in managing their product database across platforms like Shopify and Magento, resulting in duplicated work when products need to be uploaded, updated, or deleted.

**Problem Statement**

WePack needs a unified system to manage their product database, which currently contains about 180,000 unique items. This system must integrate with Shopify’s GraphQL and Magento’s REST APIs to streamline product management across all platforms from a single interface.

**Proposed Solution**

Our team is developing a centralized product management system called **WePack.PMS** that will:

- Consolidate product data into a unified system.
- Integrate with Shopify and Magento for efficient product management.
- Implement AI-driven solutions for automatic translation of product descriptions to match the languages used on different webshops.
- Handle large amounts of data and be scalable for future growth.
- Ensure user-friendly and intuitive interfaces for easy use.

### Team Members & Roles

- **Kasper**: Product Owner (PO) with in-depth knowledge of WePack’s systems and requirements, focusing on backend architecture.
- **Trygve**: Ensures a stable and functional system by leveraging expertise in Cloud Computing and Algorithms.
- **Adam**: Specializes in frontend development with a focus on UI/UX, creating an intuitive user experience using React.
