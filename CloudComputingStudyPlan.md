### General Study Tips

- **Hands-on practice** is crucial for cloud computing. Use the AWS Free Tier to practice real-world scenarios.
- **Document your learning** by writing blog posts or creating a portfolio of cloud architectures.
- **Join cloud communities** on Reddit, LinkedIn, or StackOverflow for discussions and learning resources.
- **Set up projects** that integrate multiple services to get a sense of how they work together in production.
