#### Learning Objectives for Cloud Computing

##### Subject Description

Cloud Computing refers to the concept of delivering various services over the internet, which include data storage, servers, databases, networking, software, etc. I have chosen this subject because it is a core competency in modern software development and allows for working with scalable and flexible systems. Additionally, it is an area that is relevant to many job opportunities, particularly in relation to cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure.

##### Formulation of Learning Objectives

###### Long-Term Learning Objectives

**Knowledge**

- Understanding the fundamental concepts and terminology in Cloud Computing.
- Understanding the different types of Cloud Services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and their applications.
- Understanding how cloud services can be used to create scalable applications.
- Understanding the security aspects of cloud environments.

**Skills**

- Configure and manage cloud services using AWS.
- Configure and manage cloud services using Azure.
- Design and implement scalable systems in cloud environments.
- Implement security measures to protect data and applications in the cloud.
- Use cloud-based tools to monitor and troubleshoot systems.

**Competencies**

- Identify requirements for cloud solutions and design an appropriate architecture.
- Evaluate and choose suitable cloud services based on needs.
- Acquire new knowledge of advanced cloud services and technologies.
- Integrate cloud solutions into existing IT infrastructures.

###### Short-Term Learning Objectives

- Complete an online course in AWS Cloud Essential.
- Complete an online course in Microsoft Azure Fundamentals.
- Read and understand AWS whitepapers on security and best practices.
- Implement a simple application using AWS cloud services (e.g., S3, EC2, RDS).
- Practice designing cloud architectures through hands-on exercises and mock exams.

#### Quality Criteria

##### Identification of Quality Criteria

- **Clarity**: Clear definition of cloud computing concepts and learning objectives.
- **Measurability**: Specific certifications and projects should be completed and documented.
- **Timeframe**: A clear schedule for the completion of courses and exercises.
- **Opportunity for Feedback**: Regular assessment of progress through practical exercises and exams.

##### Application of Criteria

The quality criteria serve as guidelines to ensure that the learning objectives are realistic, clear, and achievable, and that there is a clear connection between the short-term goals and the overall learning objectives.

#### Communication

The short-term goals support the long-term goals by making them concrete and actionable. For example, the long-term learning objectives of "Understanding fundamental concepts and terminology in Cloud Computing" and "Configuring and managing cloud services using AWS" are translated into specific learning activities such as courses, reading whitepapers, and practical exercises.
